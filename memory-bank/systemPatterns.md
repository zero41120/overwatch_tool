# System Patterns

- React SPA built with Vite and TailwindCSS.
- Redux store keeps input state with undo/redo.
- Optimizer loads item data and overrides at runtime and ranks builds.
- Components separated into input_view and results_view directories.
- Vitest used for unit tests with coverage thresholds in vitest.config.ts.
