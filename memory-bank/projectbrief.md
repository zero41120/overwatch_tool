# Project Brief

The Overwatch Item Optimization Tool recommends optimal item builds for each hero based on user-selected constraints.
It runs in the browser using React, TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS. The core features include:

- Select hero, available cash, and equipped items.
- Set item weights and minimum attribute groups.
- Avoid specific items and apply hero-specific overrides.
- View best build and damage breakpoints with undo/redo history.

Unit tests must keep coverage above 80%.
