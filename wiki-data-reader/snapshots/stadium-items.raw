{{DevComment|Developer Comments: We're adding additional general items to help combat fliers, such as Freja and Mercy, and give more survivability options to damage centric builds, particularly against high amounts of burst. We're also buffing up some of our situational itemization to lower the opportunity cost of purchasing them.}}

{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-20|{{DevComment|Developer comments: Stacking large amounts of Weapon Power or Ability Power have become too prevalent, crowding out other itemization options. We are lowering the cost efficiency of these items to promote greater item diversity and weaken builds that rely on high amounts of burst through stacking Weapon or Ability Power. We're also strengthening some weaker item options.}}

{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Nebula Conduit has been too efficient of a purchase given the strength of its effect. We're reducing some of the Weapon Power to put more focus on its niche and less of an obvious choice in Weapon focused builds. Booster Jets was too easily enabling builds that benefit from Move Speed, especially for a certain Tank that swings a large hammer. Generally, we're going to be looking at peeling back some of the Move Speed increases as we felt we went a bit too far. We're hoping that will help out our less mobile heroes feel like they have a better chance in Stadium.}}

{{al|Booster Jets}} – Epic Weapon Item
* Reduced Move Speed when using an ability to 10% (down from 20%).

{{al|Nebula Conduit}} – Epic Survival Item

{{DevComment|Developer Comments: We've observed that sometimes tanks can be a bit too... well, tanky! Volskaya Ordnance was a tough Item to make work for not a big enough pay off, so we're adding a little bit of power here to make it a more efficient Item to buy in those cases.}}
