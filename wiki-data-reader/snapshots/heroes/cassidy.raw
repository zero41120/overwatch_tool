;Hero Reworks

{{DevComment|We wanted to address some of Cassidy's least-picked Powers and create viable builds across his entire kit. Several new Fan the Hammer powers, such as Buck Wild, as well as the reworked Frankie's Fixer, should nudge Cassidy's close-range build towards building more tanky, rather than a glass cannon that deletes tanks. Cassidy's crit build has also gotten some love with the new Dead Man Walkin', which rewards him for taking aggressive duels and beating the odds in dangerous situations. We were also unhappy with Cassidy's High Noon build, feeling that it took too many powers and items to come online. Three powers have been condensed down to two, allowing the build to spike earlier in a match, while the new forgiveness mechanic in It's 12 O'clock Somewhere should allow Cassidy to recover quicker if his Ultimate scores no eliminations. Condensing the powers also allows Cassidy to branch out his AP options. No longer do you have to go all in on High Noon, instead Cass can flex into a ranged AP build built around Flashbang and the new Sticky Grenade Power or a close-range build with Barrel Roll (while both still having access to the powerful AP scaling on High Noon).}}

{{PatchTableElement|2025-08-26|{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Cassidy’s trusty six-shooter has always kept him sharp against fliers, but with the spicy Stadium powers, the skies have gotten downright unruly. This season, we’re giving Cassidy some upgrades to his weaker tricks so he can hold his own, keep his aim true, and remind everyone who’s the fastest draw in the West.}}

{{al|Sunrise}} - Power
* Increased slow duration to 2.5s (Up from 1.5s).

{{al|Think Flasht}} - Power
* Added: Flashbang's hinder duration is increased by 50%.

{{al|Flash In The Pan}} - Power
* Increased ultimate charge to 20% (Up from 15%).

{{al|Quick Draw}} – Power
* Increased distance to 15m (Up from 9m).

{{al|Wanted Poster}} – Rare Survival Hero Item
* Added: Deadeye damage charges 35% faster on airborne enemies.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-06-24|{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Cassidy’s roll-into-Fan-the-Hammer playstyle was always intended as a close-range burst option, but in practice, it was punishing enemies from ranges where they had little chance to respond. This adjustment refocuses that combo toward close-quarters encounters, where its high-risk, high-reward nature can shine without creating frustration at a distance.}}

{{al|Peacekeeper Alt Fire|text=Fan the Hammer}} - Secondary Fire
* Only in the Stadium mode, after 6th shot, weapon spread is increased.

{{al|Dead Man Walkin'}} - Power
* Bonus ammo is now gained on critical final blow.
* Added max cap of bonus ammo set to 4.

{{al|Just Roll With It}} - Power
* Decreased damage reduction to 25% (Down from 50%), total damage reduction is now 75% during the combat roll.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-15|{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Cassidy continues to be too dominant too consistently, especially at higher levels of play. Most of his power comes from how well he scales with Weapon Power, so shaving off a bit of his currency gain to slow down the pace of his scaling.}}

* Reduced income from damage and healing by 12.5%.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-04-25|{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Every Hero generates Stadium Cash from dealing damage and healing at a rate unique to them which we’re monitoring carefully. We think we set the rate of Cassidy’s earnings too high and he's earning a bit too much Stadium Cash, allowing him to consistently get MVPs and buy late game Items early on.}}

* Reduced the amount of Stadium Cash Cassidy gains from dealing damage and healing to 40% (down from 50%).
