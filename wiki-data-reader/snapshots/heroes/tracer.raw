{{PatchTableElement|2025-10-01|{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Tracer has been performing well across the board. We're making it a bit harder for her to reach high amounts of health to make sure there is still risk involved in her engagements. We're also hitting some of her Weapon focused Powers with a few buffs to her other builds. We'll be continuing to keep a very close eye on Tracer as we know she has a very strong relationship with Stadium's stat increases.}}
