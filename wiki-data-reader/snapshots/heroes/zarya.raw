{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-08|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Zarya continues to be overperforming, especially at higher levels of play. We're reducing some of the survivability of Weapon Power Zarya builds so that she should be more vulnerable, especially if she is opting to itemize full damage.}}

{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Lifelift has proven to be the most consistently effective Power for Zarya. We're reducing the scaling on it to try and make it feel less like a must pick in all styles of Zarya builds.

We’re also adding a little bit more healing in hopes of making Here to Spot You a bit more reliable of a power to choose from.}}
