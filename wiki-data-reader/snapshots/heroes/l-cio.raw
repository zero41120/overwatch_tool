== Balance Change Log ==
{{PatchTableStart}}<onlyinclude>
{{PatchTableElement|2025-10-14|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: We're tuning down Lúcio's most consistent build and buffing some lesser picked options to allow for increased variety in his build paths. We're also reworking Reverb to a version with more balance levers, so we can better fine tune its power level.}}

{{al|Reverb}} - Power
* Reworked to "After using Soundwave, within 4s you can use it again with 75% reduced effectiveness." (changed from "Gain 1 extra charge of Soundwave").

{{al|Crowd Pleaser}} - Power
* Healing now scales off of Soundwave's Damage (changed from 20 Flat Healing scaling with Ability Power).

{{al|Let's Bounce}} - Power
* Bonus damage now scales off of Soundwave's Damage (instead of 25 Flat Damage scaling with Ability Power).

{{al|Wallvibing}} - Power
* Max Life Overhealth every 1s increased to 4% (up from 3%).

{{al|Mixtape}} - Power
* Heal for every 1s Speed Boost was active increased to 75% of Crossfade Healing (up from 50%).

{{al|&num;1 Single}} - Rare Ability Hero Item
* Cost increased to 4500 (up from 4000).

{{al|Hip Hop}} – Epic Survival Hero Item
* Added 10% Weapon Power and 10% Ability Power.
* Removed 25 Health.
* Cost increased to 9500 (up from 9000).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-08-26|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: More dunking.}}

{{al|Beat Drop}} - Power
* Increased Max Damage from landing on an enemy with Sound Barrier to 250 (Up from 200).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-06-24|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Due to the buffs to Lucio's Crossfade Healing in the core game, we're decoupling Crowd Pleaser's healing from Crossfade. This will make Crowd Pleaser feel more impactful when outside of Amp It Up, while ensuring the healing during Amp It Up is within bounds. We're also reworking Vivace to have a more specialized niche, as well as buffing Sonic Boom to enable more build options.}}

{{al|Crowd Pleaser}} - Power
* Healing adjusted from 100% of Crossfade Healing to 20 Healing that is doubled while Amp It Up is active.

{{al|Vivace}} - Power
* Removed "While you are Wallriding, Soundwave cooldown refreshes 25% faster and adds 1 Max Ammo every 1s until you reload".
* Added "Every 1s Wallriding, you gain 3% Move Speed and 1.5% Attack Speed for 5s, stacking up to 10 times".

{{al|Sonic Boom}} - Power
* Healing now also triggers on Quick Melee damage.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-08|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Lúcio's Ability Power Healing builds have continued to give too much healing output for how accessible and consistent they are, and have been overperforming at all levels of play. We're tuning down the healing output here because of how consistently effective it is. Lúcio's Weapon Power builds have mostly been crowded out by Ability Power builds, in both output and consistency. We're adding a bit more power here to encourage some more build variety.}}

{{al|Crowd Pleaser}} – Power
* Healing reduced to 100% of Crossfade healing (down from 150%).

{{al|Let's Bounce}} - Power
* Reduced Wall Slam damage to 25 (down from 40).
* Reduced Knockback Increase to 25% (down from 30%).

{{al|Sonic Boom}} – Power
* Increased Healing to 30% of damage dealt (up from 20%).

{{al|Fast Forward}} – Power
* Increased damage increase to 30% (up from 25%).

{{al|&num;1 Single}} – Rare Ability Hero Item
* Reduced Ability Power to 5% (down from 10%).

{{al|All-Out Auditiva|text=All Out Auditiva}} – Epic Ability Hero Item
* Reduced Ability Power to 15% (down from 20%).
* Reduced Amp It Up Duration to 25% (down from 33%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-01|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: On average, Lúcio was gaining less than average Cash from damage and healing, so giving him a small bump here.

In combination with Amp It Up, Crowd Pleaser was allowing for too much burst healing that was outside of acceptable output ranges.

Amp It Up healbot builds have been a little too consistent so we’re shaving a little off from Megaphone.

Weapon Power Lúcio builds have been overshadowed by Ability Power Healing and Soundwave builds. We’re adding more consistency to Signature Shift to make it a more reliable and accessible option.

B-Side Bop has a very low pick rate, so we’re adding more Health to make it a more attractive option and add more power to less popular Lúcio builds.}}

* Increased the amount of Stadium Cash gained from damage and healing by 10%.

{{al|Crowd Pleaser}} – Power
* Healing reduced to 150% of Crossfade healing (down from 200%).

{{al|Megaphone}} – Power
* Amp It Up duration reduced to 15% (down from 20%).

{{al|Signature Shift}} – Power
* Increased Projectile Size increased to 80% (up from 20%).

{{al|B-Side Bop}} – Epic Weapon Hero Item
* Health increased to 50 (up from 25).
