== Balance Change Log ==
{{PatchTableStart}}<onlyinclude>
{{PatchTableElement|2025-08-26|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Head Honcho has always been a bit of a gamble, high risk but not always high reward. With this update, we’re making it a safer pick that feels more consistently useful while keeping the overall power ceiling in check.}}

{{al|Head Honcho}} – Power
* Remove resets on reload.
* Decreased cap to 15% (Down from 30%).

{{al|Early Detonation}} - Power
* Now only heals amount of reloaded ammo when restoring health through Reload Therapy.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-06-24|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Silver Spurs has been underperforming and often lacked synergy with common builds. This update improves its utility and cohesion, making it a more rewarding option that better complements a variety of playstyles. B.O.B. Jr. has proven to be a strong utility option and great for locking down control points while catching enemies off-guard with early ultimate. However, its effectiveness at holding territory became a bit too reliable. We're adjusting its strength to bring it more in line with other options, while still retaining its strategic value.}}

{{al|B.O.B. Jr.}} - Power
* Decreased duration to 10s (Down from 20s).

{{al|Reload Therapy}} - Power
* No longer generates currency.

{{al|Silver Spurs}} - Rare Survival Hero Item
* Increased duration to 5s (Up from 3s).
* Now reloads 25% of max ammo on coach gun use.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-29|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Ashe has been steadily climbing in overall competitiveness, but she’s still missing that extra oomph when the moment calls for it. These buffs target some of her underperforming powers and items, giving her more flexibility across different builds and helping her stay impactful in a wider range of scenarios.}}

{{al|Out with a Bang}} - Power
* Decreased Explosives damage reduction to 30% (Down from 66%).

{{al|Molten Munitions}} - Power
* Increased damage to 80 (Up from 50).
* This change will not be represented correctly on the tooltip but it will be functionally set to 80. This information in the tooltip will be fixed next season.

{{al|Reload Therapy}} - Power
* Increased heal to 10% (Up from 3%).

{{al|Sidewinder}} – Epic Weapon Hero Item
* Increased attack speed to 15% (Up from 10%).
* Increased damage to 25% (Up from 15%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-08|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Ashe has strong potential in the hands of experienced players, but parts of her kit have been falling off in the later stages of the game compared to other heroes. We're making targeted adjustments to help her scale more effectively into the late game, while also smoothing out some of the sharp edges that make her less forgiving for newer players. These changes aim to make Ashe a more rewarding pick across all skill levels.}}

{{al|Head Honcho}} - Power
* Increased damage increase per unscoped shot landed to 5% (up from 3%).

{{al|B.O.B. Jr.}} - Power
* Reduced Attack Speed reduction to 20% (down from 50%).

{{al|Infrared Lenses}} – Epic Ability Hero Item
* Fixed an issue where the increased damage against Burning targets was only applying to The Viper and B.O.B. Now increases all damage dealt by Ashe to Burning targets.
* Reduced increased damage to Burning targets to 20% (down from 25%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-04-22|
