== Balance Change Log ==
{{PatchTableStart}}<onlyinclude>
{{PatchTableElement|2025-10-23|
{{DevComment|Juno’s kit has been seeing high versatility, but a few powers weren’t keeping up with the pace of current matches. These updates give her stronger offensive and defensive options with more punch from range, faster follow-ups, and sturdier healing.}}

{{al|Rally Ring}}
* Increased cooldown reduction to 1.5s (Up from 1s).
{{al|Hyper Healer}}
* Increased overhealth to 85 (Up from 75).
{{al|Gravitational Push}}
* Increased attack speed to 35% (Up from 20%).
{{al|Long Range Blaster}}
* Increased weapon power to 20% (Up from 15%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-09-16|
{{DevComment|Developer comments: PulStar Destroyers were underwhelming compared to other Epic tier options. This boost should make this hero item feel far more destructive and worthy of its name.}}

{{al|PulStar Destroyers}} - Epic Ability Hero Item
* Damage increased to 35 (Up from 20).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-08-26|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Juno lost her blinky shoes, and her performance took a hit. While some players were happy to see her less airborne, it made it much harder for Juno to stay impactful. This buff helps her regain strength while making sure she doesn’t end up permanently zipping around the skies.}}

{{al|Orbital Alignment}} - Power
* Now enemies within the Orbital Ray will float up.

{{al|Blink Boosts}} - Power
* Increased cooldown reduction to 40% (Up from 30%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-07-24|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Medimaster wasn’t quite delivering the payoff expected for a critical-focused builds. This buff increases its crit multiplier to better reward precision and reinforce its role as a high-risk, high-reward option for skilled players.}}

{{al|Medimaster}} - Power
* Increased critical scalar to 1.5 (Up from 1.25).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-07-22|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Stellar Focus lacked a clear standout strength compared to other power options, often feeling underwhelming in practice. This update aims to give it a more defined impact, helping it stand out as a meaningful and competitive choice in your build.}}

{{al|Stellar Focus}} - Power
* Increased duration to 50% (Up from 35%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-07-09|
{{DevComment|Developer comments: Juno’s Blink Boosts have been dominating the skies, especially when paired with ability-survival items to gain overhealth and damage repeatedly. After reviewing performance data and player feedback, we've committed to a multi-step approach to bring this build back into balance. This update is the second step in that process, with more adjustments planned to ensure a healthier gameplay experience for both Juno players and their opponents.}}

{{al|Blink Boosts}} - Power
* Decreased Cooldown Reduction to 30% (Down from 65%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-07-08|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: At higher MMR tiers, Juno has earned the nickname "Flying Tracer" for good reason. Her survivability, especially after Round 3, made her extremely slippery and difficult to deal with. This base adjustment is focused on slightly reducing her survival capability to keep her challenging without feeling unfair to eliminate.}}

{{al|Hyper Healer}} - Power
* Decreased Overhealth to 75 (Down from 100).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-06-24|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Juno had a standout performance last season, with Pulsars delivering consistently high impact. For this season, we’re making targeted adjustments to slightly lower its peak output while opening up more room for build variety. The goal is to preserve her strength while encouraging a broader range of viable playstyles.}}

{{al|Forti-Glide|text=Evasive Glide}} - Hero Item
* Removed.

{{al|Lock-On Shield}} - Rare Survival Hero Item.
* Changed Item category from Ability to Survival.
* Changed Item stat from 10% Ability Power to 25 Health.
* Decreased Overhealth scalar to 25% (Down from 50%).

{{al|Boosted Rockets}} - Epic Survival Hero Item.
* Changed Item rarity from Rare to Epic.
* Changed Item price from 4000 to 12000.
* Updated Item effect: During Glide Boost, gain 10% Damage Reduction.

{{al|Medicinal Missiles}} - Power
* Removed additional 30 Healing.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-29|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Hyper Ring has seen frequent use in Juno’s kit, but it hasn’t kept pace with the impact of her other powers. We're giving it a boost to bring it in line with the rest of her options, making it a more competitive pick that rewards smart positioning and timing.}}

{{al|Hyper Healer}} - Power
* Increased Overhealth to 100 (Up from 50).

{{al|Black Hole}} - Power
* Increased Slow duration to 2 seconds. (Up from 1 second).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-01|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: We know Juno has been very popular in Stadium but we’re addressing some of the most oppressive aspects of those builds in this update. We have found that on average, Juno was earning less Cash from damage and healing than other heroes, especially in the early rounds. We’re increasing this to help balance out with some of the Pulsar Torpedo build nerfs, as well as to help out the other Juno builds that are underperforming.

Pulsar Torpedo enthusiasts have been everywhere you look in Stadium and sometimes it feels like there's always a Pulsar Torpedo chasing you. We're reducing the cooldown of Cosmic Coolant per hit to reduce some of her ability pacing.

We felt that PulStar Destroyers had too much vertical power for damage focused Pulsar Torpedo builds. We've replaced the Ability Power with Ability Lifesteal to retain that aggressive playstyle.

Solar Shielding was providing too much Ability Power combined with its effect at its current cost.}}

* Increased the amount of Stadium Cash gained from damage and healing by 33.33%.

{{al|Cosmic Coolant}} – Power
* Cooldown per target hit reduced to 0.5 second (down from 1 second).

{{al|PulStar Destroyers}} – Epic Ability Hero Power
* Removed 15% Ability Power.
* Added 10% Ability Lifesteal.

{{al|Solar Shielding}} – Epic Ability Hero Power
* Ability Power reduced to 15% (down from 25%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-04-22|
; Introducing Stadium
* Tank Heroes: D.Va, Junker Queen, Orisa, Reinhardt, and Zarya.
* Damage Heroes: Ashe, Cassidy, Genji Mei, Reaper, and Soldier: 76.
