== Balance Change Log ==
{{PatchTableStart}}<onlyinclude>
{{PatchTableElement|2025-10-23|
{{DevComment|Sigma’s recent buffs gave him a bit too much cosmic dominance, allowing him to stay in the air too long while dealing heavy burst damage. We’re dialing back Trinisphere and Zero Gravity slightly to keep his power in check while preserving the fun of his gravity-focused playstyle.}}

{{al|Trinisphere}}
* Decreased damage to 50% (Down from 75%).

{{al|Zero Gravity}}
* Decreased damage reduction to 10% (Down from 15%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-10-14|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Sigma’s gravity defying builds weren’t feeling as cosmic as they should. These changes let him stay airborne longer, sling stronger spheres, and fully embrace his inner astrophysicist without feeling weighed down.}}

{{al|Zero Gravity}} - Power
* Flight duration increased to 4s (Up from 2.5s).
* Damage reduction increased to 15% (Up from 10%).
{{al|Apogee Alignment}} - Power
* Removed Hypersphere damage reduction.
* Text will be updated in the Mid Season patch.
{{al|Trinisphere}} - Power
* Third Hypersphere damage increased to 75% (Up from 50%).
* Text will be updated in the Mid-Season patch.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-09-16|
{{DevComment|Developer comments: Several of Sigma's items and powers have proved too situational and we're giving them a tune-up. Additionally, his Beam counter item should now be more effective against other Tanks on the roster (looking at you, Reinhardt).}}

{{al|Maestro}} - Power
* Added: Gravitic Flux refunds 50% of Ultimate Charge if no enemies are affected.

{{al|Volatile Gravel}} - Rare Ability Hero Item
* Bonus Ability Power reworked to now deal damage with Accretion and grants 5% Ability Power until the end of the round, stacking up to 4 times.

{{al|Beam Splitter}} - Rare Survival Hero Item
* Now also reduces Melee damage while active.
* Damage reduction increased to 75% (up from 50%).

{{al|Synced Shielding}} - Rare Survival Hero Item
* Weapon Power and Attack Speed granted while behind Experimental Barrier increased to 10% (up from 5%).
* Move Speed and Lifesteal granted while in front of Experimental Barrier increased to 10% (up from 5%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-08-26|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Sigma is going through a series of balance updates aimed at smoothing out his overall performance. One of his toughest matchups has been against brawlers who can charge in and overwhelm him. This update is part of the ongoing improvements to give Sigma more tools to hold his ground and perform better in those high-pressure encounters.}}

{{al|Zero Gravity}} - Power
* Added: While flying, gain 10% Damage Reduction.

{{al|The Harness}} – Epic Ability Hero Item
* Added: +15% Ability Lifesteal.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-08-07|
{{DevComment|Developer Comment: Sigma’s barrier wasn’t scaling well into the late game, often feeling too fragile compared to the pressure he’s expected to absorb. We’ve increased its health to give it more staying power as fights become more intense. Additionally, Accretion focused builds have been underperforming, largely due to the ability’s slower cadence in fast paced brawls. With a cooldown buff, Accretion should now be more responsive and impactful! Especially in late game teamfights where frequent crowd control can shift momentum.}}

* Increased Barrier Health Scalar to 150% (Up from 100%). Barriers now get a bigger health boost from the money you earn.

{{al|Hyperloop}} - Power
