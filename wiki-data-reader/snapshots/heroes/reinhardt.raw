{{PatchTableElement|2025-10-14|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Removing this item to remove redundancy with the new Exo Springs Gadget.}}

{{al|Rocket Boots (Reinhardt)}}
* Removed
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-06-24|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: We're shifting some power in the Fire Strike build to focus more on higher uptime of Fire Strike and Magma Strike's Trail of Lava, while pulling back from the high single target burst that Impact Burst enabled. We're also making some adjustments to Reinhardt's Barrier build to make it a more compelling option and have a smoother progression curve.}}

{{al|Impact Burst}} - Power
* Now only damages other enemies around primary target.
* Explosion damage increased to 30% of Fire Strike damage (Up from 15%).

{{al|Magma Strike}} - Power
* Trail of lava now triggers on every second Fire Strike instead of every second Fire Strike cast within 2s.

{{al|Chimera's Maw}} - Epic Hero Ability Item
* Rarity changed to Epic (from Rare).
* Added 25% Fire Strike Projectile Speed.
* Added "For each additional enemy Fire Strike damages beyond the initial target, reduce Fire Strike cooldown by 5%".

{{al|Rocket Strike}} - Epic Hero Ability Item
* Removed.

{{al|Wilhelmwagen}} - Epic Hero Survival Item
* Changed to Epic Survival Item (from Power).
* Added 50 Armor.
* 11000 Cost.
* Removed "you heal for 5% of the damage it mitigates".

{{al|Infusion Generator}} - Power
* Changed to Power (from Epic Survival Item).
* Barrier Field Health increase now only increases from Bonus Max Life.
* Barrier Field Health scaling increased to 250% (up from 100%).

{{al|To Me, My Friends!|text=To Me, My Friends}} - Power
* Increased healing based on Max Life to 5% (up from 4%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-29|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: The interaction between Feeling the Burn and effects that triggered off Rocket Hammer damage proved to be too strong, so we're removing it while giving some small improvements to some underutilized powers and items.}}

{{al|Barrier Reconstruction}} - Power
* Increased Barrier Health Restoration from Damage to 15% (up from 10%).

{{al|Feeling the Burn}} - Power
* No longer applies to Smashing and Dampener Grip.

{{al|Dampener Grip}} – Epic Weapon Hero Item
* Increased Ability Power to 15% (up from 10%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-20|
{{DevComment|Developer comments: To compensate for the buff to Reinhardt's Fire Strike in Core Overwatch, we're decreasing the burst potential of Reinhardt's Fire Strike build and normalizing the max projectile speed Fire Strike can reach. We're also tuning down Reinhardt's Melee build to be a bit more counterable, which is performing too consistently given the high payoff of the build.}}

{{al|Smashing!|text=Smashing}} - Power
* Reduced Move Speed per stack to 1% (down from 2%).
* Reduced Life Steal per stack to 3% (down from 5%).
* Increased maximum stacks to 10 (up from 5).
* Reduced duration to 2s (down from 3s).

{{al|To Me, My Friends!}} - Power

* Decreased Ability Power to 10% (down from 20%).

{{al|Chimera's Maw}} - Rare Hero Ability Item
* Decreased Ability Power to 5% (down from 10%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-08|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Reinhardt has been overperforming, especially at lower levels. We're tuning down some of the powers that are most difficult to counterplay, such as Melee Reinhardt feeling inescapable due to his crazy amount of Move Speed or being one shot by an Impact Burst Fire Strike. As an important known issue with this balance change, the Move Speed per stack is currently not represented correctly on the tooltip but it is functionally set to 2%. This will be fixed in a future update.}}

{{al|Impact Burst}} – Power
* Reduced bonus damage to 15% (down from 20%).

{{al|Smashing!|text=Smashing}} – Power
* Reduced Move Speed per stack to 2% (down from 3%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-01|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Reinhardt had a higher rate of earning Cash from damage and healing due to his range. However, Reinhardt has been overperforming and making a bit too much Cash so we’re pulling this back a bit.}}

* Reduced the amount of Stadium Cash gained from damage and healing by 13.64%
}}
