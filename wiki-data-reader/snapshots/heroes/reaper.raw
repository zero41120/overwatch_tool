{{DevComment|Developer Comments: This update to Reaper is primarily looking at making Ability Power Reaper a bit more reliable in the early and mid rounds. We're reorganizing where some of the power of the build lies, as well as fixing a few interactions that were not quite working correctly. We'll be keeping a close eye on this build as it has high snowball potential when it works. We're also reducing the power of Wraith Renewal as it has been a consistent high performer in terms of survivability and cash gain.}}

{{DevComment|Developer Comments: We're squashing a few bugs that we believe have contributed to Reaper's high win rate. We're also making a slight adjustment to Revolving Ruin's ramp up time and maximum stacks.
