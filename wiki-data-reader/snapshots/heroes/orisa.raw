{{PatchTableStart}}<onlyinclude>
{{PatchTableElement|2025-10-14|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Orisa’s ability power build was falling off in the late game, leaving her damage underwhelming compared to other options. This update gives her more scaling so she can stay a real threat as matches go longer.}}

{{al|Advanced Throwbotics}} - Power
* Damage increased to 75% (Up from 50%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-09-16|
{{DevComment|Developer comments: These updates give Orisa more durability and impact. Scorched Earth hits harder, her barriers scale better with her role, and Supercharger now has the staying power to anchor big moments in a fight.}}

{{al|Scorched Earth}} - Power
* Damage increased to 25% (Up from 20%).

{{al|Shield Divergence}} - Power
* Barrier now gains extra health from passive health gain.

{{al|Supercharger}} - Power
* Supercharger base health increased to 400 (Up from 200).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-09-04|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Orisa was having a tough time holding her ground against beam-heavy foes like Zarya. This update gives her a sturdier answer so she can stare down beams a bit longer and keep the frontline strong.}}

{{al|Refraction Tiles}} - Rare Survival Hero Item
* Damage reduction increased to 75% (Up from 50%).
}}

{{PatchTableElement|2025-07-22|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Orisa’s javelin-focused build has been effective at disrupting enemies, but it also came with some clunky interactions that impacted its reliability and clarity. This patch addresses those rough edges to smooth out the experience and help her disruption tools to feel more responsive and intuitive to use.}}

{{al|Advanced Throwbotics}} - Power
* Now shoots the javelin after 0.5s and the Javelin Spin must be ongoing to shoot. Canceling Javelin Spin will also cancel shooting the javelin.

{{al|Lassoed}} - Power
* If a javelin hits an enemy, nearby enemies are pulled to the enemy's position now instead of where it was hit.
* If a javelin hits the environment, it just pulls nearby enemies.
* If a javelin hits a barrier, the pull will not activate.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-06-24|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: These 2 items have been underperforming, lacking the stat needed to be more impactful. This update addresses that by adding item stat to them.}}

{{al|Siphonic Spear}} - Rare Survival Hero Item.
* Added stat: 25 Health.

{{al|Arcfinder}} - Rare Ability Hero Item.
* Added stat: 5% Cooldown reduction.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-29|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Orisa’s Overheat build was underperforming, especially when it came to holding the line against aggressive pushes. It lacked the punch needed to deter advancing enemies or force them to reposition. This buff aims to bolster her ability to apply pressure and make her presence more threatening when anchoring space.}}

{{al|Scorched Earth}} - Power
* Increased damage to 20% (Up from 10%).

{{al|Electro Lights}} – Rare Hero Weapon Item
* Increased recovery rate to 50% (Up from 25%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-01|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: We've observed many scenarios where it feels like Orisa can become invincible. In combination with some of her other powers and items, we felt that Restorify was healing too much.

Solar Regenergy was too efficient for its cost, so we’re tuning it back to be more in line with items of similar cost.}}

{{al|Restortify}} – Powers
* Reduced healing to 5% of your Max Life every 1 second (down from 10%).

{{al|Solar Regenergy}} – Rare Survival Hero Item
* Reduced Armor Restoration to 3% of Max Life (down from 5%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-04-22|
