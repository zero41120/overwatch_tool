== Balance Change Log ==
{{PatchTableStart}}<onlyinclude>
{{PatchTableElement|2025-06-24|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Frontliners continues to be one of Soldier 76's least popular options. We're allowing the Overhealth to stack to enable more synergies with Powers that create additional Biotic Fields to allow for more build paths.}}

{{al|Frontliners|text=Frontline}} - Power
* Overhealth now stacks when multiple Biotic Fields are active at once.
* Overhealth based on Max Life reduced to 25% (down from 30%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-29|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Biotic Field builds have been unpopular and underperforming, so we're adding some additional firepower there. Chaingun has been very prevalent in all types of Weapon Power builds for Soldier, so we're tuning it down a bit to allow for some more variety.}}

{{al|Hunker Down}} – Power
* Increased Biotic Field duration to 50% reduced duration (up from 30% reduced).

{{al|Chaingun}} - Power
* Decreased Weapon Power per shot to 0.4% (down from 0.5%).

{{al|Battery Pack}} – Rare Ability Hero Item
* Increased Biotic Field Duration to 40% (up from 30%).

{{al|Rapid Response Radius}} – Epic Ability Hero Item
* Increased Biotic Field radius to 40% (up from 30%).

{{al|Compression Fatigues}} – Rare Survival Hero Item
* Removed 5% Attack Speed.
* Added 5% Ability Power.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-20|
{{DevComment|Developer comments: Soldier 76's Helix Rocket build is one-shotting a little too consistently. We're decreasing the damage here a bit to reduce the burst potential.}}

{{al|Cratered}} - Power
* Reduced increased Explosion Damage to 15% (down from 25%)
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-01|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Soldier 76 has been consistently making too much money from damage and healing, allowing him to consistently snowball his lead.

We love that players have been enjoying using Rocket Visor. It's been great to see some players pick up Soldier: 76 who may not have played him much in the past. That said we have always intended for the build centered around Rocket Visor to be a strong accessible build, but not necessarily the build with the highest practical performance ceiling. We've seen that it's overperforming and can feel frustrating to play against. We're hoping to reduce a bit of the power with this change, but we will continue to keep a tactical eye on this build as we move forward with more balance updates.

We felt the payoff for making Biotic Bullseye work was a bit too low to be worth it.}}

* Reduced the amount of Stadium Cash gained from damage and healing by 12.5%.

{{al|Super Visor|text=Rocket Visor}} – Power
* Duration reduced to 0.5 seconds (down from 0.75 seconds).

{{al|Biotic Bullseye}} – Power
* Increased ammo restoration to 10% per critical hit (up from 5%).
